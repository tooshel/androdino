==Using the ADK (Accessory Development Kit) and Arduino to do awesome things==

A (short) introduction to Arduino and Accessory Development Kit (ADK).

We hook up a regular Arduino just so people don't think there is anything special about the ADK hardware itself (beside the host mode USB and, oh, how the new ADK hardware isn't Arduino at all).




Sheldon graduated with a degree in electrical engineering but even while he was getting that degree he worked as a web developer for the engineering department. Fifteen years later and I'm just as confused about how inductors work as everyone else. 

Sheldon is a web developer and has been since he was in college and made the website that allowed students to keep track of their grade for the first year engineering class.  He ended up with a degree in electrical engineering but never again saw a circuit diagram . . . until Arduino. Now all that knowledge of resistors and capacitors is coming back and he's starting to realize that everything he learned in college is simple common knowledge to Arduino hackers.
