Using the ADK (Accessory Development Kit) and Arduino to do awesome things
=========

A (short) introduction to Arduino and the Accessory Development Kit (ADK) is first up. The ADK hardware is great but it's not necessary to get started in the world of microcontrollers so we'll show off the ADK hardware as well as regular Arduino hardware. Then a little about electronics. More about Arduino and "sheilds". Then a little about our project to take advantage of all this microcontroller knowlege.



About Sheldon:
---------

Sheldon graduated with a degree in electrical engineering but even while he was getting that degree he worked as a web developer for the engineering department. Fifteen years later and I'm just as confused about how inductors work as everyone else. 

Sheldon is a web developer and has been since he was in college and made the website that allowed students to keep track of their grade for the first year engineering class.  He ended up with a degree in electrical engineering but never again saw a circuit diagram . . . until Arduino. Now all that knowledge of resistors and capacitors is coming back and he's starting to realize that everything he learned in college is simple common knowledge to Arduino hackers.

About Jim:
---------

Jim got a CS degree and then went on to write code at several companies but it mostly all ended up as HTML and CSS. Except that time he worked for a game company but he doesn't like to talk about that. Now he writes Java at work and loaths Java otherwise but he did this Android project anyway.
